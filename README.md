<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## Project Description

![image1][image1]

Respiratory viruses like the COVID-19, spread when mucus or droplets containing the virus get into your body through your eyes, nose or throat (Sheeran, 2020). Most often, this happens through your hands. Hands are one of the most common ways that the virus spreads from one person to the next (Misra, 2018). During a global pandemic,like the one we are experiencing today, one of the cheapest, easiest, andÂ most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water (Misra, 2018). 

SoapSafe is a Augmented Reality application which aims to inform users of the beneficial effects of proper hand washing. The application educates and motivates while creating an interactive experience.
